arkanhockey beta file

ArkanHockey is a top-down game developed using a platform I'm developing that I plan to call "Arkan".

The platform will allow easy implementation of game logics, sprites animation, physics, a simple input controll, both by touch and by keyboard / mouse. Cross compatible between different devices and differend browsers aiming to run smoothly on mobile devices.
